//Tomas and Efra (27/12/2021)
-> We create the project with Angular
-> We decided more or less the first design

//First steps - Efra (06/01/2022)
-> We create a new component called main, that is the main page in where we'll put all the main
things, like the button of events, parties and the profile of the user
-> We create a new interface called User, to have each user with his id, name, etc
-> We create the first user in the main (a test user), later we'll create all the 
interface for register, login etc, but first we want to have the main structure
